Simple interface that resembles an OS (e.g., folders, app dock, etc.). The current app mocks up a Mac display and enables drag/drops of folders; future-state app could allow users to log in, save files, and import app integrations into his/her online desktop.

## Demo

## Future-state ideas
1. Log into the app (with a google-only strategy)
2. Create, edit, open, or delete folders through desktop interface click / double click / right click interactions
3. "Import" apps to main dock for easy access
4. Edit settings, such as pre-set color themes
